My humble submissions to http://2013.nwerc.eu/en/

I tried the contest all alone. No problem with the testsession, but
the problems in the real contest turned out to be too hard to be able to complete alone in just 5 hours. It took me 3 hours just to decide problem G was the easiest one and to finish implement it.

In the test session A and B was correct, while C has some bug in it. I might fix the bug later. In the contest itself problem G was correct, but I missed the deadline to turn in B (I believe it to be correct though). If code for any of the other problems turns up in these directories, it has been added after the contest.
